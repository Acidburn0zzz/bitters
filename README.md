Bitters
===
Add a dash of predefined style to your [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) stylesheets.

Bitters is meant to help designers get projects started faster. It adds enough predefined structure and style to get started quickly but not enough to dictate any style.

Throw the base folder into your projects stylesheets and edit it to your sites design.

It is recommended that you use Bitters with a reset like Normalize.

- Sass 3.0+
- Bourbon 2.0+
